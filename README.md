# ABOUT

This project was designed as a quick and easy way to see how colors look in the browser. While many websites (e.g. CodePen) and programs have live previews which offer similar functionality, I made this for its simplicity. 

The first version is simply a page with a hex/color code in the middle which you can change, and the background color will change to match whatever code you entered.

The second version has a few more features, allowing you to use different schemes for trying colors, as well as a way to try gradients too.

The third version includes new elements on the page so that you can try out a color scheme for different elements rather than just one color.
