# ABOUT

This project was my attempt to make an absolutely simple way of testing/trying colors in the browser. I've tried to include most of the major methods for representing color, and there is a navigation dropdwon for going between the pages. 

Usage is simple: clone/copy this repository to your computer and open up the HTML file you want to use in your browser. You can change the values on the page just by selecting them and typing something new. One thing to note is that these pages do require JavaScript, so keep that in mind if it's not working for you.
